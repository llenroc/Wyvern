Project Wyvern: The Gamer's Coin.
===============================

Wyvern was created to provide a coin that is easily accessible to gamers. Using the NIST5 algorithm, gamers can mine with GPUs (or CPUs at a slower rate) without ASIC interference. This gives everyone a fair chance to contribute to the network.  NIST5 was chosen due to causing lower operating temperatures than other algorithims. Wyvern may be exchanged for Steam items or games, as well as many popular MMO items. By using a Pow/Pos hybrid system, Wyvern ensures the coin has longevity past its mining period, and Pos will also encourage retention of the coin.

Getting started mining with Windows binaries
=============================================

1) Download wyvern-qt.exe to a folder of your choice and launch it twice (Due to an unsolved bug, the app will crash on first launch as it attempts to create a wallet. Don't panic! Just relaunch it and it will open successfully).
2) Join the pool at `wyv.suprnova.cc <http://wyv.suprnova.cc/index.php?page=gettingstarted>`_
 and follow the instructions there. 

Build instructions
===================

Debian
-------

First, make sure that the required packages for Qt5 development of your
distribution are installed, for Debian and Ubuntu these are:

::

    apt-get install qt5-default qt5-qmake qtbase5-dev-tools qttools5-dev-tools \
        build-essential libboost-dev libboost-system-dev \
        libboost-filesystem-dev libboost-program-options-dev libboost-thread-dev \
        libssl-dev libdb++-dev

then execute the following:

::

    qmake
    make

Alternatively, install Qt Creator and open the `wyvern-qt.pro` file.

An executable named `wyvern-qt` will be built.


Windows
--------

Windows build instructions:

- Download the `QT Windows SDK`_ and install it. You don't need the Symbian stuff, just the desktop Qt.

- Download and extract the `dependencies archive`_  [#]_, or compile openssl, boost and dbcxx yourself.

- Copy the contents of the folder "deps" to "X:\\QtSDK\\mingw", replace X:\\ with the location where you installed the Qt SDK. Make sure that the contents of "deps\\include" end up in the current "include" directory.

- Open the .pro file in QT creator and build as normal (ctrl-B)

.. _`dependencies archive`: https://download.visucore.com/wyvern/qtgui_deps_1.zip
.. [#] PGP signature: https://download.visucore.com/wyvern/qtgui_deps_1.zip.sig (signed with RSA key ID `610945D0`_)
.. _`610945D0`: http://pgp.mit.edu:11371/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x610945D0


Mac OS X
--------

- Download and install the `Qt Mac OS X SDK`_. It is recommended to also install Apple's Xcode with UNIX tools.

- Download and install `MacPorts`_.

- Execute the following commands in a terminal to get the dependencies:

::

	sudo port selfupdate
	sudo port install boost db48 miniupnpc

- Open the .pro file in Qt Creator and build as normal (cmd-B)

Build configuration options
============================

UPNnP port forwarding
---------------------

To use UPnP for port forwarding behind a NAT router (recommended, as more connections overall allow for a faster and more stable wyvern experience), pass the following argument to qmake:

::

    qmake "USE_UPNP=1"

(in **Qt Creator**, you can find the setting for additional qmake arguments under "Projects" -> "Build Settings" -> "Build Steps", then click "Details" next to **qmake**)

This requires miniupnpc for UPnP port mapping.  It can be downloaded from
http://miniupnp.tuxfamily.org/files/.  UPnP support is not compiled in by default.

Set USE_UPNP to a different value to control this:

+------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| USE_UPNP=- | no UPnP support, miniupnpc not required;                                 |
+------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| USE_UPNP=0 | (the default) built with UPnP, support turned off by default at runtime; |
+------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| USE_UPNP=1 | build with UPnP support turned on by default at runtime.                 |
+------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Notification support for recent (k)ubuntu versions
---------------------------------------------------

To see desktop notifications on (k)ubuntu versions starting from 10.04, enable usage of the
FreeDesktop notification interface through DBUS using the following qmake option:

::

    qmake "USE_DBUS=1"

Generation of QR codes
-----------------------

libqrencode may be used to generate QRCode images for payment requests. 
It can be downloaded from http://fukuchi.org/works/qrencode/index.html.en, or installed via your package manager. Pass the USE_QRCODE 
flag to qmake to control this:

+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| USE_QRCODE=0 | (the default) No QRCode support - libarcode not required                 |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| USE_QRCODE=1 | QRCode support enabled                                                   |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+


Berkely DB version warning
==========================

A warning for people using the *static binary* version of wyvern on a Linux/UNIX-ish system (tl;dr: **Berkely DB databases are not forward compatible**).

The static binary version of wyvern is linked against libdb 5.0 (see also `this Debian issue`_).

Now the nasty thing is that databases from 5.X are not compatible with 4.X.

If the globally installed development package of Berkely DB installed on your system is 5.X, any source you
build yourself will be linked against that. The first time you run with a 5.X version the database will be upgraded,
and 4.X cannot open the new format. This means that you cannot go back to the old statically linked version without
significant hassle!

.. _`this Debian issue`: http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=621425

Ubuntu 11.10 warning
====================

Ubuntu 11.10 has a package called 'qt-at-spi' installed by default.  At the time of writing, having that package
installed causes wyvern-qt to crash intermittently.  The issue has been reported as `launchpad bug 857790`_, but
isn't yet fixed.

Until the bug is fixed, you can remove the qt-at-spi package to work around the problem, though this will presumably
disable screen reader functionality for Qt apps:

::

    sudo apt-get remove qt-at-spi

.. _`launchpad bug 857790`: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/qt-at-spi/+bug/857790
